# Coffee, Comics & Critical Hits – Brand Claim

I, **wacheek** (online handle derived from my initials and surname), am the original creator of the brand name **"Coffee, Comics & Critical Hits"**, intended for use as a unique retail experience combining:

- A comic book shop
- A coffee café
- Tabletop gaming space (e.g., D&D, Warhammer 40k, Magic The Gathering, Pokemon)
> *Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer 40k, Magic: The Gathering, and Pokémon are registered trademarks of their respective owners. These references are made solely to describe the types of games the space will accommodate and do not imply any affiliation or endorsement.*

This name was originally conceived many years ago and has been refined independently over time. As of **May 13, 2025**, I have publicly claimed the associated domain:

> **cccrits.com**

This repository serves as a **timestamped public record** of my intent to use and protect this brand concept. All rights are reserved, and this posting may be used as supporting evidence of original authorship and commercial intent.
